# text = """Advertising companies say advertising is necessary and important. It informs people about
# new products. Advertising hoardings in the street make our environment colourful. And
# adverts on TV are often funny. Sometimes they are mini-dramas and we wait for the next
# programme in the mini-drama. Advertising can educate, too. Adverts tell us about new,
# healthy products. And adverts in magazines give us ideas for how to look prettier, be
# fashionable and be successful. Without advertising, life is boring and colourless.
# But some consumers argue that advertising is a bad thing. They say that advertising is bad
# for children. Adverts make children ‘pester’ their parents buy things for them. Advertisers
# know we love our children and want to give them everything. So they use children’s ‘pester
# power’ to sell their products. Finally, consumers say, if there is advertising there must be
# rules. Some adverts advertise unhealthy things like cigarettes and make people waste their
# money."""
